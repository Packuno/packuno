## Usage

First, log in with your Google credentials.

Secondly, in the Dashboard view, enter your destination and travel dates to generate a new packing list for your upcoming trip. On the dashboard, you will have the option to copy packing lists from previous trips.

On submitting your criteria for the new packing list, you will be redirected to a new page where you can add and remove items to a packing list. If you have selected an old packing list from a previous trip to copy over, you will see the old list rendered before you.
